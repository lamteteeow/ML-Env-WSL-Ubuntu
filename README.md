# ML-Env-WSL-Ubuntu
This repo is to support the libraries and dependencies that are not supported in the native Windows environment. A virtual environment was created within WSL Ubuntu to use PyTorch and Tensorflow more smoothly.

The aim was to train models using ML-Agents tool-kit for Unity editor.

The next aim is to apply MuJoCo â€” Advanced Physics Simulation open-source engine in Unity.
